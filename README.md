# Harmonic-decomposition-approach-to-dynamical-friction-for-eccentric-orbits
This repository contains code and results used in the paper "Harmonic-decomposition approach to dynamical friction for eccentric orbits"

The repository contains the simulations' measurements for the angular momentum and energy dissipation rates used in the paper, specifically for figures 4 and 5. The results are found in the files "angular_dissipation" and "energy_dissipation".
